# Sun - Differential rotation of the Sun

@author: Jorge Eliécer Sanabria Hernández

Use the images downloaded from https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/ and store them in the 'img /' folder. It is recommended to use the images of (4096 x 4096) px.

To process the images and store the data use:

    python sun.py 4096

Then, to process the data use:

    python sun.py -l

The result will be the equation obtained by polynomial regression of the Sun's differential velocity and three descriptive images, plotting data of interest for the analysis of the situation.
